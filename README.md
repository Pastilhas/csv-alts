The format comma-separated values (CSV) has a series of inconsistencies as pointed out by [Stenway](https://github.com/Stenway). With this in mind, there is a need to create a new form to import/export data to improve speed / readability / simplicity.

1. Speed &mdash; to improve speed, 2 things can be done:
    - Create a simpler standard &mdash; a well defined, unambiguous, compact standard leads to less computations required, improving speed of encoding/decoding;
    - Reduce readability &mdash; by basing the standard on difficult to read yet compact formats, memory usage and time reading data can be reduced
